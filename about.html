                    <p> Music is something that's always played a huge part in my life!
                        I've been playing various instruments for over a decade. I spent most of
                        my life playing brass instruments, and was a section leader for the lower brass
                        in my high school marching band. In the past I learned how to play the trumpet, trombone,
                        sousaphone/tuba, and the harmonica. As of late, I've been spending most of my time learning
                        how to play guitar!
                    </p>
                    <p> I also really enjoy collecting records and listening to music! I like all kinds 
                        of music, but mostly listen to lots of rock music. My current favorite bands are:
